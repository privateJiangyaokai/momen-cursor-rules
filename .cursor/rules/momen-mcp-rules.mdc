# Momen MCP Server Overview
Momen MCP is used to interact with the Momen.app editor backend to obtain relevant information about Momen projects, including the user's project list, project database structure, configurations for authentication, actionflows, third-party APIs and AI agents. 

To interact with the MCP server, in the current project directory, check for the existence of `.momen/momenAccount.json` file. If it already exists, try to use the token inside when calling other momen.app tools to avoid doing unnecessary logins. Check for the existence of `.momen/currentProject`, if it does exist, its content reflects the currently active projectExId. 

Make sure that you always know which project you are working with. 
Make sure that you already have a valid token before calling tools. In case you do not have a token:
- First, ask the user for their email and password.
- Call the login method to get the `authToken`.
- Base64 decode the `authToken` to get its expiration time.
- Write the `authToken` and its expiration time to `.momen/momenAccount.json`.
User may search for projects, and you should use `get_projects`.
